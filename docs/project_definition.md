# Backend Architecture Course Project

## Objective
The student's goal is to learn how to develop a Backend system from scratch, starting from the interpretation of "business requirements" to its implementation. This should be done considering the planning of an architecture that details at a high level how the proposed system meets the use cases derived from the requirements.

## Client Requirements

The company "RandomCameraReviews" needs a system that allows professional photographers to upload "reviews" of cameras, so that anyone from anywhere in the world can search for the reviews and buy them through their portal.
The company has a specialized front-end development team that will create a portal for editors to upload the "reviews" and for users to view them. They have requested that you, as a Backend specialist, provide them with a system, including an API, that allows the following:

* Upload camera reviews
* Retrieve the content of the reviews to display it on the portal's web and mobile views.
* User management for editors (excluding visitors who read the reviews)

It is also known that the company "RandomCameraReviews" plans to distribute mainly in South America where their largest market is, but they also have sales in North America, Europe, and very few in Asia.
